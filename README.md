# Shellimate

This is completely useless but it's pretty cool anyway so yeah

## Python Version

You're gonna need Python 3.10.2, most likely. That's the version I use to develop Shellimate, and that's not changing without a notice. [Here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3102/)

## How-To

Shellimate's first public beta is still in the works, so this isn't that important.

## Security

Not planning to add any features that communicate with online databases, but I'll update this section *should that time come.*

Don't download this yet, it's literally just a markdown file. I'll update this repo when the beta is ready.
