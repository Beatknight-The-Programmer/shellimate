# Shellimate

This is completely useless but it's pretty cool anyway so yeah

## Additional Dependencies

You're gonna need [Python 3.10.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3102/). That's the version I use to develop Shellimate, and there's a pretty slim chance it's changing.

## What's Coming

In the first alpha, you'll be able to make the animations and get a save code to paste somewhere. Hopefully saves won't require you copying a bunch of data by the time beta releases.

Plus, many new features before full release, such as:
- Selectable framerates
- Selectable canvas sizes
- Selectable color depths
- Subtitles

## Pitch In

If you want to modify the code, it'll be out soon so you can fork it. Keep in mind Shellimate is based on CPython 3.10.2
